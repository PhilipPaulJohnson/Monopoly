OVERVIEW: This Python app encapsulates the classic board game, Monopoly. All official cards, board-spaces, etc. have been imported 

HOW IT WORKS: This is a text-based four player Monopoly game (You vs 3 computer generated players) that is run in your terminal or in the cloud @ pythonanywhere (RECOMMENDED) 

WHERE IT'S GOING: At this time the game is capped at 45 turns till I develop end-game and mortgage functions

PERSONAL NOTE: This is my first portfolio project mostly written during the few weeks of my Python module at bootcamp. I wanted a challenge that would showcase my current knowledge of OOP, classes & instances
